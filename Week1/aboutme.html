		<h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Cynthia and I'm currently a third year studying Statistics and Digital Humanities. At UCLA,
            I'm a member of Sigma Eta Pi and also involved as a Director of Marketing for TAMID. I also play IM volleyball
            and was formerly a Track and Field Team Manager. Here are some fast facts:
        </p>
        <li><b>Hobbies</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Taking care of my houseplants</li>
            <li>Finding new places to hike at</li>
            <li>Eating Tacos</li>
            <li><i>Going to music festivals</i></li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        </li>

        <p>My goals for this course include becoming proficient in GIS, gaining confidence in coding, as well as 
            accumulating a breadth of new technologies for my toolbelt. I'm <i>SUPER</i> excited to begin the 
            quarter and look forward to the next 10 weeks!
